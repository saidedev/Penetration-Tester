## **🏆 Master Penetration Testing Certification Path**

If you want to be a **master penetration tester**, you need certifications that focus on **hands-on hacking, real-world exploitation, and advanced penetration testing techniques**. Here’s a structured **penetration testing certification path** from beginner to expert level:

---

### **🔥 Step 1: Beginner-Level (Foundational Skills)**

✔ **eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)** – Best for beginners, hands-on labs

✔ **CompTIA Pentest+** – Covers pentesting fundamentals but not hands-on

✔ **CompTIA Security+** – Covers cybersecurity basics, good for foundational knowledge

✅ **Recommended:** Start with **eJPT** to learn practical penetration testing.

---

### **💣 Step 2: Core Penetration Testing Certifications**

✔ **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** – The most recognized penetration testing certification

✔ **eCPPTv2 (eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester)** – Good alternative to OSCP, covers real-world scenarios

✔ **GPEN (GIAC Penetration Tester)** – Covers methodology, good for corporate pentesting

✅ **Recommended:** **OSCP** is a must-have. If you want an alternative, go for **eCPPTv2**.

---

### **⚡ Step 3: Advanced Penetration Testing (Red Team & Active Directory)**

✔ **OSEP (Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester)** – Advanced penetration testing (Post-exploitation, Active Directory, AV evasion)

✔ **CRTO (Certified Red Team Operator)** – Focuses on red teaming & adversary simulation

✔ **CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional)** – Active Directory exploitation & privilege escalation

✅ **Recommended:** After OSCP, go for **OSEP** (for advanced pentesting) and **CRTO** (for red teaming).

---

### **🚀 Step 4: Web Application & API Penetration Testing**

✔ **OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert)** – Advanced web hacking & exploit development

✔ **eWPTX (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester eXtreme)** – API hacking, SSRF, and advanced web exploits

✔ **Burp Suite Certified Practitioner** – Focuses on real-world web hacking using Burp Suite

✅ **Recommended:** If you want to specialize in **web penetration testing**, get **OSWE + eWPTX**.

---

### **💻 Step 5: Exploit Development & Advanced Hacking**

✔ **OSED (Offensive Security Exploit Developer)** – Exploit development, buffer overflows

✔ **GXPN (GIAC Exploit Researcher & Advanced Penetration Tester)** – Exploit research, fuzzing, advanced post-exploitation

✔ **GREM (GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware)** – Reverse engineering & malware analysis

✅ **Recommended:** If you want to master **exploit development**, go for **OSED + GXPN**.

---

### **☁ Step 6: Cloud & Mobile Penetration Testing**

✔ **GCPN (GIAC Cloud Penetration Tester)** – AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud pentesting

✔ **AWS Certified Security – Specialty** – AWS security for pentesters

✔ **GMOB (GIAC Mobile Device Security Analyst)** – Mobile pentesting for Android & iOS

✅ **Recommended:** If you want to work in **cloud security**, get **GCPN**. If you’re interested in **mobile pentesting**, get **GMOB**.

## **🏴‍☠️ Final Roadmap to Master Penetration Testing**

1️⃣ **Start with eJPT** (Beginner hands-on penetration testing)

2️⃣ **Get OSCP** (Most important certification for penetration testers)

3️⃣ **Go for OSEP + CRTO** (Advanced penetration testing & red teaming)

4️⃣ **Master web hacking with OSWE** (For web application penetration testing)

5️⃣ **Learn exploit development with OSED + GXPN** (Advanced hacking & fuzzing)

6️⃣ **Expand into cloud & mobile security with GCPN or GMOB**

This path will make you a **master penetration tester** with skills in **network, web, cloud, and exploit development**.

📌 **If you want just one certification, get OSCP.**

📌 **If you want to be elite, go all the way to OSCE3 (OSEP + OSWE + OSED).**
